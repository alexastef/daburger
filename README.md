## Installation  
 
    npm i  


## Usage  
To use this repo, user should have a good understanding of JavaScript, NodeJS, MySQL, MVC structuring, ahdn Handlebars or other templating language. Postman is helpful when testing API routes as well. I started building the backend first, then frontend: ORM --> Model --> Controller --> frontend JS --> HTML/Handlebars --> CSS   

To start application, run npm start:  
 
    npm start  
 



## Tests  

    npm test
